# <h1> Python-Studying </h1>

This repository consists of a selection of code snippets and mini-projects I've created while learning programming in Python, associated technologies and good practices. 
 


<h2> General Info </h2> 

Created files/programs have a studying and exercising value. They are really simple but numerous hence I don't create a separate repository for each of them.

I have divided them into two folders:

<h4> 'trying_learning_exercises' </h4>

The folder 'trying_learning_exercises' is my rough draft where I learn and try out Python's syntax, semantics, most necessary libraries and connections with other technologies etc. It's filled with lists of exercises, very basic code I wrote along with tutorials or very rubbish code which I broke or stripped down purposely to understand it better. 

<h4> 'mini-projects' </h4>

The folder 'mini-projects' is packed with simple but actually functioning and usable programs. The description of the purpose of the program is commented out at the beggining of each code. They are mainly products of various programming challenges for beginners (like games or generators), simple programs to run CRUD queries on various databases or interactive sites using Web Frameworks. I return to them every so often when I come up with a new solution after learning a new skill. 

<h2>Technologies</h2> 

The languages and technologies I've used/tested are:
- Python 3.6
- MySQL 8.0
- PostgreSQL 12.3
- MongoDB 4.4
- Flask 1.1x
- HTML
- CSS

<h2> Setup </h2> 

There are no general set up requirements. In the name of each program I have usually indicated the technology I've used/tested in a specific program.

<h2> Status </h2> 

Always in progress as there is always something to learn:)
